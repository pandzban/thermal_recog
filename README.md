Project of Python script using 2-layer neural network to recognize gestures.

The samples for training can be acquired, and tagged by script gui, whilst training needs to be done in external program, not included here.

NN reads 4 frames in period of 0.25 sec. between particular samples.
Every one second it calculates it's output.

The gestures are as follows:
1) A Fist
2) Open palm
3) Open palm approaching sensor
4) One finger
5) Two fingers
6) Palm moved left(or right)
7) Palm moved right(or left)
8) Idle (no printing)
